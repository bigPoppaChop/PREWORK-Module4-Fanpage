        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>In the year 2688, humankind has built a Utopia because of the music of Wyld Stallyns.</p>
        <p>In the year 1989 however, Wyld Stallyns is known only as two high school slackers named Bill S. Preston, Esq. and Theodore Logan.
        <br>The pair have been recently assigned to make a presentation for their history class, which neither has been doing well in.
        <br>With a looming threat of military school for Ted if he fails the class and friction between Bill and his mother, the pair begin working on their report
        <br>by the Circle K, where strange things are destined to be afoot.
        <br>
        <br>It is here they meet Rufus, a time traveler from the Utopian a who is tasked with helping Bill and Ted with their history presentation.
        <br>With some convincing from themselves to trust Rufus, they begin an adventure through time where they aquire the assistance of some of history's most notable people.
        <br>After saving the historical figures from being locked up for their hijinks at the San Dimas Mall, Bill and Ted give their presentation and pass their course.
